# The Giveback License

**Disclaimer**: I am not a lawyer. Due to a lack of a bar card, I cannot give you
legal advice. I disclaim all liability from the use of these licenses. If you
have need of actual legal advice, please contact a qualified lawyer.

This license aims to address two concerns of software development:
    1. Open source licenses can sometimes make adopting that software in a
       a commercial project hard or impossible
    2. Commercial projects will often adopt a permissively licensed open source
       project and never contribute back to it.

Thus, I have adapted the MIT License to require that any modifications to the
open source project must be contributed back to the original source repo. My
vision for this is that organizations which are highly resistant to sharing
their products' source code will be able to use Giveback-licensed code in their
products, and if they make improvements to the open-source code they use, those
improvements have to get contributed back to the project in a timely manner.

This is good for everybody:
    - Commercial entities get free software to use in their products
    - Open source projects get contributions by paid developers from time to
      time as companies use the project and adapt/improve it to their needs
    - Developers at companies with ambiguous open source policies can feel
      secure in using Giveback-licensed code to speed their development, knowing
      that its use does not meaningfully affect product release requirements,
      and their paid efforts to improve an open source project are not only
      allowed, but *required* to be contributed back to the open-source
      community.
